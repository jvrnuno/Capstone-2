# Prediction Tool for Utility Consumption Cost in Residential Units 

> *What is the estimated billing cost of utilities in a residential unit, given the attributes available on any listing services website?*

US total residential energy consumption in 2019 was 3,487.55 Terawatts-hour (1) representing a $460B ticket for homeowners and rental property investors. This economic burden is difficult to manage since it is usually tied to construction features or building systems that are costly to replace or renew, and it is usually known only after the first year of making the purchase decision. 

Understanding utilities bill costs before-hand could lead to higher competitiveness in the real estate market driving energy efficient innovation and practices, and eventually benefiting the final buyer or investor.

Currently, retail buyers often find difficulties to estimate the real cost of utilities when scouting the market for a new house or condo. Most listing services and realtors do not have the information or tools to predict bill costs, and it can weigh heavily on the buying decision.  

The present project aims to provide homeowners and retail investors a powerful tool to estimate with a high degree of confidence the yearly utilities bill cost, just by providing a few parameters shown in a typical listing services website.
