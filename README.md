# Predicting Energy Consumption Cost In Residential Units 

> *What is the estimated cost of energy in a residential unit, given the attributes available on any listing services website?*

US total residential energy consumption in 2019 was 3,487.55 Terawatts-hour representing a $460B ticket for homeowners and rental property investors. This economic burden is difficult to manage since it is usually tied to construction features or building systems that are costly to replace or renew, and house energy consumption expenses are usually known only after the first year of making the purchase decision.

Currently, buyers often find difficulties to estimate the potential real cost of energy bill when scouting the market for a new house or condo. Most listing services and realtors do not have the information or tools to predict bill costs, and it can weigh heavily on the final buying decision.

Also, understanding the factors that determine the energy bill before-hand could lead to higher competitiveness in the real estate market, encouraging energy efficient innovation and practices, and eventually benefiting the final buyer or investor.

The present project aims to provide homebuyers, homeowners, and retail rental property investors a powerful tool to estimate the yearly energy bill, just by providing a few parameters shown in a typical listing services website, such as RedFin, Realtor.com, or Zillow.

The steps followed in this projects are:
1.Data collection and inspection. [Notebook here](link)
2.Data cleaning and variable optimization.
3.Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
4.Pre-processing.
5.Modeling and results.
