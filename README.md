# Single-Family House Retrofit Prediction Tool
US total residential energy consumption in 2019 was 3,487.55 Terawatts-hour  representing a $460B ticket. Single-family house upgrades could increase energy efficiency, enhance comfort, reduce utility cost, raise the value of the property for homeowners, and ultimately reduce US energy demand and carbon footprint.
Homeowners often find difficulties to decide which is the best strategy or retrofit measures to implement within a limited budget. Software-based energy performance simulation could be inaccurate and as a theoretical model, it does not consider other constraints, such as local costs, contractorâ€™s availability, and installation efficiency. 
A statistical model based on real build cases can be an additional powerful decision-making tool to efficiently deploy financial resources for house upgrading.

**Problem questions:**
1. What are the most cost-efficient retrofit measures for US single-family homes by house location, footage, occupation, and construction year?
2. Furthermore, what are the expected energy savings in the first year and return of investment for homeowners when any set of upgrade measures are installed?
